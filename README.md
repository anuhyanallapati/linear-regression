# This repository contains the source code for a basic linear regression model using sci-kit learn library from my second year (February 2023).
## The linear classifier was made for 15 different degrees of poylnomials and the results were compared.
## Submission
- The tasks to be performed are mentioned in `Assignment 2.pdf`
- The submission for this project is a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) `code.ipynb` containing the source code used in the model. The notebook is available in the repository above.
- The submission also includes a report `report.pdf` which contains the results of the model and a brief explanation of the code.
- `test_dataset.pickle` and `train_dataset.pickle` are the datasets used for testing and training the model.
